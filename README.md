Sparse Bundle Band Archiver - Group band files into archives of configurable size, to facilitate uploading

To use, change your working directory to the "band" folder inside a .sparsebundle package. Then run the group_bands shell script. Archives will be placed outside the sparse bundle.

Ex: 
% cd /path/to/image.sparsebundle/bands 
% ~/group_bands.sh
